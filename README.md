# Project: Traffic Sign Classification

### Overview
In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural network architectures to classify traffic signs. I will train the model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will test the model. Detailed description about my project is [Project Explanation Paper](https://github.com/basarYargici/traffic_sign_classifier_GTSRB/blob/main/Project%20Explanation/ProjectExplanationPaper.pdf)

Data set contents:
* The size of training set is: 34799
* The size of the validation set is: 4410
* The size of test set is: 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is: (32, 32 ,3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is: 43
